# Password manager

Simple password manager using Tkinter and original graphics (optimized for Mac, but will work on Windows as well).

The program will save your sign-in data (website, username, password) into a local document data.txt.
Additionally, upon saving the data, the program will store the password in the clipboard.

The app also includes password generator and has a search function for finding already saved information.


# How to Run

You need to have python interpreter installed. Download the folder and unzip, in terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) type "python main.py".
NB: pyperclip library needs to be installed for the clipboard functionality to work; to remove it, delete lines 5 and 53.
